# Titanic_Survival_Prediction

This project is aiming to build a machine learning model to predict the survival of titanic passengers based on descriptive features of the passengers such as Name, age, Sex, class of travel, port Embarked etc.

This project is divided into two steps:

Step I: Extracting patterns and correlation between features and our target(Preprocessing).

Step II : Building an accurate ML model.
